* Improve the index.

* Describe the grammar (grammar.texi).

* More examples.

* Some things from NEWS that might not be documented yet:

  * Expressions of the form

      A(i,j) = x

    where X is a scalar and the indices i and j define a matrix of
    elements now work as you would expect rather than giving an error.
    I am told that this is how Matlab 5.0 will behave when it is
    released.
    (assignment)

  * Octave's parser now does some simple constant folding.  This means
    that expressions like 3*i are now evaluated only once, when a
    function is compiled, and the right hand side of expressions like
    a = [1,2;3,4] are treated as true matrix constants rather than
    lists of elements which must be evaluated each time they are
    needed.
    (???)

  * Octave now attempts to continue after floating point exceptions
    or out-of-memory errors.
    (???)

  * If Octave crashes, it now attempts to save all user-defined
    variables in a file named `octave-core' in the current directory
    before exiting.
    (???)

  * The info reader is now a separate binary that runs as a
    subprocess.  You still need the info reader distributed with
    Octave though, because there are some new command-line arguments
    that are not yet available in the public release of Info.
    (install)

  * If it is present, Octave will now use an `ls-R' database file to
    speed up recursive path searching.  Octave looks for a file called
    ls-R in the directory specified by the environment variable
    OCTAVE_DB_DIR.  If that is not set but the environment variable
    OCTAVE_HOME is set, Octave looks in $OCTAVE_HOME/lib/octave.
    Otherwise, Octave looks in the directory $datadir/octave (normally
    /usr/local/lib/octave).
