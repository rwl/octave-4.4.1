The files in this directory have been modified from those found on
netlib by changing the following subroutine names

  zabs --> xzabs
  zexp --> xzexp
  zlog --> xzlog
  zsqrt --> xzsqrt

to avoid conflicts with non-standard but commonly used Fortran
intrinsic function names.

More files have been modified to recover Matlab compatibility for
Bessel functions. Now the output is always computed, independently
from the magnitude of the input

  cbesh.f
  cbesi.f
  cbesj.f
  cbesk.f
  zbesh.f
  zbesi.f
