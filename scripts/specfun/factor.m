## @deftypefn  {} {@var{pf} =} factor (@var{q})
## @deftypefnx {} {[@var{pf}, @var{n}] =} factor (@var{q})
## Return the prime factorization of @var{q}.
##
## The prime factorization is defined as @code{prod (@var{pf}) == @var{q}}
## where every element of @var{pf} is a prime number.  If @code{@var{q} == 1},
## return 1.
##
## With two output arguments, return the unique prime factors @var{pf} and
## their multiplicities.  That is,
## @code{prod (@var{pf} .^ @var{n}) == @var{q}}.
##
## Implementation Note: The input @var{q} must be less than
## @code{flintmax} (9.0072e+15) in order to factor correctly.
